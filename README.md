# Ansible Modules for Arista CloudVision Platform


## About

[Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/) supports Ansible for managing devices running the EOS operating system through [CloudVision platform (CVP)](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/eos-cloudvision). This roles includes a set of ansible modules that perform specific configuration tasks on CVP server. These tasks include: collecting facts, managing configlets, containers, build provisionning topology and running tasks. For installation, you can refer to [specific section](#git-installation) of this readme.

## Modules overview

This repository provides content for Ansible's collection __arista.cvp__ with following content:

- [__arista.cvp.cv_facts__](docs/cv_facts.md) - Collect CVP facts from server like list of containers, devices, configlet and tasks.
- [__arista.cvp.cv_configlet__](docs/cv_configlet.md) -  Manage configlet configured on CVP.
- [__arista.cvp.cv_container__](docs/cv_container.md) -  Manage container topology and attach configlet and devices to containers.
- [__arista.cvp.cv_device__](docs/cv_device.md) - Manage devices configured on CVP
- [__arista.cvp.cv_task__](docs/cv_tasks.md) - Run tasks created on CVP.

This collection supports CVP version `2018.2.x` and `2019.1.x`

### Important notes.

This repository is built based on [new collections system](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html#developing-collections) introduced by ansible starting version __2.9__. 

> It means that it is required to run at least ansible `2.9.0rc4` to be able to use this collection.

## Installation

### Dependencies

This collection requires the following to be installed on the Ansible control machine:

- ansible >= `2.9.0rc4`
- requests >= `2.22.0`
- fuzzywuzzy running `0.17.0` or later
- treelib version `1.5.5` or later

### Git installation for testing

You can git clone this repository and use examples folder for testing. This folder contains a set of pre-configured playbook and ansible configuration:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp.git
$ cd ansible-cvp/examples
$ make build
```

> It is highly recommended to use a python virtual-environment to not alter your production environment.

### Git installation

You can git clone this repository and use examples folder for testing. This folder contains a set of pre-configured playbook and ansible configuration:

__Clone repository__
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp.git
$ cd ansible-cvp
```

__Build and install collection__

```shell
$ ansible-galaxy collection build --force arista/cvp
$ ansible-galaxy collection install arista.cvp.*.tar.gz
```

## Example playbook

This example outlines how to use `arista.cvp` to create a containers topology on Arista CloudVision.

Some playbook examples are provided in [__`examples`__](examples/) folder with information about how to built a test environment.

Below is a very basic example to build a container tology on a CloudVision platform assuming you have 3 veos named `veos0{1,3}` and a configlet named `alias`

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to demonstrate cv_container module.
  hosts: cvp
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  collections:
    - arista.cvp
  vars:
    containers_provision:
        Fabric:
          parent_container: Tenant
        Spines:
          parent_container: Fabric
        Leaves:
          parent_container: Fabric
          configlets:
              - alias
          devices:
            - veos03
        MLAG01:
          parent_container: Leaves
          devices:
            - veos01
            - veos02
  tasks:
    - name: "Gather CVP facts from {{inventory_hostname}}"
      cv_facts:
      register: cvp_facts

    - name: "Build Container topology on {{inventory_hostname}}"
      cv_container:
        topology: '{{containers_provision}}'
        cvp_facts: '{{cvp_facts.ansible_facts}}'
        save_topology: true
```

As modules of this collection are based on [`HTTPAPI` connection plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/connection/httpapi.html), authentication elements shall be declared using this plugin mechanism and are automatically shared with `arista.cvp.cv_*` modules.

```ini
[development]
cvp_foster  ansible_httpapi_host=10.90.224.122

[development:vars]
ansible_connection=httpapi
ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=True
ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=False
ansible_user=cvpadmin
ansible_password=ansible
ansible_network_os=eos
ansible_httpapi_port=443
```
