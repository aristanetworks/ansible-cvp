# dhcp_configuration role

Ansible role to provision and configure Zero Touch Provisioning on a CloudVision server. Role will do the following:

- Install DHCP package
- Activate DHCPd service on CloudVision.
- Create `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file with relevant information.
- Reload `dhcpd` service to apply changes.

## Requirements

No specific requirements to use this role.

## Tested Platforms

Below is a list of platforms where DHCPd configuration has been tested:

- Centos 7 / 8
- Ubuntu 18.02
- Arista CloudVision 2019 and onward (for lab purpose)

This role should work on any platform running [ISC-DHCP server](https://www.isc.org/dhcp/).

> If role is applied to CloudVision server, DHCP configuration may be erased during upgrade process. Use it at your own risk in a production environment.

## Example Playbook

### Generate DHCPD configuration to deploy on a DHCP server

```yaml
---
- name: Configure DHCP service on CloudVision
  hosts: dhcp_server
  gather_facts: false
  collection:
    - arista.cvp
  vars:
    ztp:
      default:
        registration: 'http://10.255.0.1/ztp/bootstrap'
        gateway: 10.255.0.3
        nameservers:
          - '10.255.0.3'
      general:
        subnets:
          - network: 10.255.0.0
            netmask: 255.255.255.0
            gateway: 10.255.0.3
            nameservers:
              - '10.255.0.3'
            start: 10.255.0.200
            end: 10.255.0.250
            lease_time: 300
      clients:
        - name: DC1-SPINE1
          mac: '0c:1d:c0:1d:62:01'
          ip4: 10.255.0.11
        - name: DC1-SPINE2
          mac: '0c:1d:c0:1d:62:02'
          ip4: 10.255.0.12
        - name: DC1-LEAF1A
          mac: '0c:1d:c0:1d:62:11'
          ip4: 10.255.0.13
  tasks:
  - name: 'Execute DHCP configuration role'
    import_role:
      name: arista.cvp.dhcp_configuration
    vars:
      mode: offline
      output_dir: '{{inventory}}'
```

### Configure Server to act as ZTP server

Below is a basic playbook running `arista.cvp.dhcp_configuration` role

```yaml
---
- name: Configure DHCP service on CloudVision
  hosts: dhcp_server
  gather_facts: true
  collection:
    - arista.cvp
  vars:
    ztp:
      default:
        registration: 'http://10.255.0.1/ztp/bootstrap'
        gateway: 10.255.0.3
        nameservers:
          - '10.255.0.3'
      general:
        subnets:
          - network: 10.255.0.0
            netmask: 255.255.255.0
            gateway: 10.255.0.3
            nameservers:
              - '10.255.0.3'
            start: 10.255.0.200
            end: 10.255.0.250
            lease_time: 300
      clients:
        - name: DC1-SPINE1
          mac: '0c:1d:c0:1d:62:01'
          ip4: 10.255.0.11
        - name: DC1-SPINE2
          mac: '0c:1d:c0:1d:62:02'
          ip4: 10.255.0.12
        - name: DC1-LEAF1A
          mac: '0c:1d:c0:1d:62:11'
          ip4: 10.255.0.13
  tasks:
  - name: 'Execute DHCP configuration role'
    import_role:
      name: arista.cvp.dhcp_configuration
```

Inventory is configured like below:

```yaml
---
all:
  children:
    CVP:
      hosts:
        dhcp_server:
          ansible_host: 1.1.1.1
          ansible_user: user1
          ansible_password: password1
          ansible_become_password: password1
          ansible_python_interpreter: $(which python3)
```

If you are not using **root** user, configure `ansible_become_password` since role always use `become: true`.
