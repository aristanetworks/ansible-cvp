# Ansible CVP Collection testing

## Configure Pytest

- Unit test with no CV interaction to test component: tests/unit
- System test to run module backend component and which requires CV connection: tests/system
- lib to provides a safe place for fixtures, parametrizes, mook data: tests/lib

### Test requirements

- Cloudvision server with some devices
- Pytest install as per [collection dev requirements](../ansible_collections/arista/cvp/requirements-dev.txt)

### Configuration file

Configure a configuration file under __tests/unit__ to set your Cloudvision information:

- Username
- Password
- Server

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# coding: utf-8 -*-

username = "< Your CV username >"
password = "< Your CV password >"
server = "< your CV server IP >"
```

A command alias is available in Makefile under __tests__:

```bash
$ make config.py
Generate config.py for Cloudvision auth
---
Update unit/config.py with your credentials
```
