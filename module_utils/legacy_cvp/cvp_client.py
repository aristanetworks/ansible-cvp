''' RESTful API Client class for Cloudvision(R) Portal

This module provides a RESTful API client for Cloudvision(R) Portal (CVP)
which can be used for building applications that work with Arista CVP.

When the class is instantiated the logging is configured.  Either syslog,
file logging, both, or none can be enabled.  If neither syslog nor filename is
specified then no logging will be performed.

This class supports creating a connection to a CVP node and then issuing
subsequent GET and POST requests to CVP.  A GET or POST request will be
automatically retried on the same node if the request receives a
requests.exceptions.Timeout or ReadTimeout error.  A GET or POST request will
be automatically retried on the same node if the request receives a
CvpSessionLogOutError.  For this case a login will be performed before the
request is retried.  For either case, the maximum number of times a request
will be retried on the same node is specified by the class attribute
NUM_RETRY_REQUESTS.

If more than one CVP node is specified when creating a connection, and a GET
or POST request that receives a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError,
requests.exceptions.HTTPError, or a requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects will
be retried on the next CVP node in the list.  If a GET or POST request that
receives a requests.exceptions.Timeout or CvpSessionLogOutError and the retries
on the same node exceed NUM_RETRY_REQUESTS, then the request will be retried
on the next node on the list.

If any of the errors persists across all nodes then the GET or POST request
will fail and the last error that occurred will be raised.

The class provides connect, get, and post methods that allow the user to make
direct RESTful API calls to CVP.

Example:

    >>> from cvprac.cvp_client import CvpClient
    >>> clnt = CvpClient()
    >>> clnt.connect(['cvp1', 'cvp2', 'cvp3'], 'cvp_user', 'cvp_word')
    >>> result = clnt.get('/cvpInfo/getCvpInfo.do')
    >>> print result
    {u'version': u'2016.1.0'}
    >>>

The class provides a wrapper function around the CVP RESTful API operations.
Each API method takes the RESTful API parameters as method parameters to the
operation method.  The API class was added to the client class because the
API functions are required when using the CVP RESTful API and placing them
in this library avoids duplicating the calls in every application that uses
this class.

Example:

    >>> from cvprac.cvp_client import CvpClient
    >>> clnt = CvpClient()
    >>> clnt.connect(['cvp1', 'cvp2', 'cvp3'], 'cvp_user', 'cvp_word')
    >>> result = clnt.api.get_cvp_info()
    >>> print result
    {u'version': u'2016.1.0'}
    >>>
